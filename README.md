# Getting Started with Create React App

A React frontend application for a media sharing platform allows users to upload images or videos, view a list of
all images and videos, and like/unlike them. The app consumes a RESTful API to perform these operations.

## Typical React App

It's a typical React App that you can start through:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
